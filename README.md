# JobTrack

JobTrack is a web application *in development*.
Once refined and deployed, this web application will be a tool for job seekers that need to track their job application process.

## Environment

In this stage, JobTrack runs locally.
SQL is used as a DBMS/ JDBC to store entries.
Apache Tomcat (Tomcat) is used to host SQL database as a server.
Web application connects to SQL DB.

## Future Intent

Host JobTrack on online server to remove the necessity of SQL and Tomcat.
Java application ran on online server for any user to use application.

### Task List

* Migrate application to public server online
* Make HTML and CSS prettier (add some fancy stuff)
* Make "export to .csv" button work for local systems
* Set up "contact us" mailbox
* Lots of other stuff...brainstorming...
